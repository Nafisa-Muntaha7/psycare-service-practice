### `Why do you need it?`

Once you start making the effort to ‘wake yourself up’—that is, be more mindful in your activities—you suddenly start appreciating life a lot more.

Life doesn’t make any sense without interdependence. We need each other, and the sooner we learn that, the better for us all.

### `Psycotherapy`

Supportive psychotherapy helps patients deal with issues related to their mental health conditions which in turn affect the rest of their lives. It helps build self-esteem, reduce anxiety, strengthen coping mechanisms, and improve social and community functioning.

Process: Talk to me first, book your session and come sit with me.

### `Counseling`

Magical and Inspirational lessons for people facing mental stress.

No one experiences perfect mental health or well-being all of the time. We all have to learn how to balance the different aspects of our lives. When things in our life change, we have to re-establish the balance.


### `About Us`
